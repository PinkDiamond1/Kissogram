Compiles, but it has been a while since I tested it on a device. It probably
works still, but if it doesnâ€™t it would just be a few minor regressions.

Was in the store, but is removed now (well soon).

Some code is a bit weird: I was being experimental.

There are tags for each supported Swift version. Master is Swift 2 (Xcode 7).
